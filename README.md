Module 5 Pandas Visualization Challenge

Analysis:
Looking at the statistics the data throws we can observe that the drugs that were used the most were Capumoline / Ramicane.
Also the population of mice is fairly even between male and female, male mice population is slightly larger by 0.7 percent.
Results show that both Ramicane and Capomuline have a significantly lower volumes compared to other drugs and placebo.
A sample of a Mouse show a decrease in tumor volume over time, meaning that the treatment for this particular mouse had a good outcome.
There is also a strong correlation of Mouse Weigh and Tumor Volume, this means lighter mouse have smaller tumors, heavier mouse have larger tumors.
